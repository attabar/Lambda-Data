### What is AWS?

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is a comprehensive and widely adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. It provides a wide range of infrastructure services such as computing power, storage options, and networking capabilities to businesses and developers. Some of its popular services include:

- **Amazon EC2**: Virtual servers to run applications.
- **Amazon S3**: Scalable storage in the cloud.
- **Amazon RDS**: Managed relational database services.
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless computing.
- **Amazon CloudFront**: Content delivery network (CDN).

### Why Recommend AWS for Hosting?

1. **Scalability**: AWS provides tools and services that can automatically scale your applications up or down based on demand. This is crucial for handling variable loads, such as a surge in users during exam periods.

2. **Reliability**: AWS has a global network of data centers with redundancy and backup, ensuring high availability and uptime for your application.

3. **Security**: AWS offers robust security measures, including encryption, DDoS protection, and compliance with various industry standards, which is essential for protecting sensitive student data.

4. **Cost-Effectiveness**: With a pay-as-you-go pricing model, AWS allows you to only pay for the resources you use, which can be more cost-effective than maintaining your own infrastructure.

5. **Managed Services**: AWS provides managed services for databases, caching, content delivery, and more, reducing the operational burden on your development team and allowing them to focus on building and improving your application.

6. **Flexibility**: AWS supports various programming languages, operating systems, and architectures, giving you the flexibility to use the tools and technologies that best fit your project's needs.
